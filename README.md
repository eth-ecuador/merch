# Merch Project

A Base-native Proof of Attendance protocol that uses Digital Merch NFTs, demonstrating a **low-cost, friction-minimized user experience** and validating the **freemium monetization model** on the **Base Sepolia Testnet**.

## üéØ Project Overview

Merch is a revolutionary Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) built specifically for Base L2, featuring:

- **Creator-Driven Content**: Creators upload merch images to IPFS for community use
- **Event Management**: Users create events with claim codes for attendance tracking
- **Dual Token Model**: Soulbound Tokens (SBT) for permanent attendance proof + ERC-721 NFTs for collectible value
- **Low-Cost UX**: Minimal L2 gas fees with off-chain reservation options
- **Signature-Based Security**: Public minting with backend signature verification
- **EAS Integration**: Immutable attestation records for verifiable attendance
- **Freemium Monetization**: Free basic claims with premium upgrade options

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

This project is organized across three specialized repositories:

| Repository | Purpose | Technology |
|------------|---------|------------|
| [**merch-contracts**](https://github.com/eth-ecuador/merch-contracts) | Smart contract implementation | Solidity, Foundry |
| [**merch-backend**](https://github.com/eth-ecuador/merch-backend) | API/Backend service | Node.js, TypeScript |
| [**merch-miniapp**](https://github.com/eth-ecuador/merch-miniapp) | Frontend Mini-App | React, MiniKit |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Developers

1. **Clone all repositories**:
   ```bash
